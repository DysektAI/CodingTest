# Web Language Proficiency Tester

## Overview
The Web Language Proficiency Tester is an innovative tool designed to assess and enhance understanding of web languages such as HTML through structured, progressive testing. Unlike traditional testing formats, our approach emphasizes a deep understanding of language documentation and best practices rather than rote memorization. This project is open-source, licensed under the AGPLv3 to ensure that all derived works remain free and open for community use and contribution.

## Project Purpose
This project aims to address shortcomings in standard certification processes which often prioritize passing tests over genuine understanding. Our tester provides:
- **Randomized Content**: Ensures tests are challenging and focus on understanding rather than pattern recognition.
- **Progressive Learning**: Functions like a course, helping users start from basic concepts and advance through more complex ones.
- **Detailed Feedback**: Offers in-depth feedback on each answer, showing what users know well and what they need to study more.
- **Version-specific Testing**: Allows users to test on different versions of a language, understanding changes over time and ensuring compatibility with older systems.

## Why AGPL?
We chose the Affero General Public License Version 3 (AGPLv3) because it:
- Ensures that any modifications, especially in a server-side context, remain open and accessible to the community.
- Helps prevent proprietary use without contributing back to the original project.
- Supports our vision of an open, collaborative educational environment where improvements are shared.

## Features
- **Adaptive Testing**: Tests adapt based on the user's knowledge level, making it suitable for both beginners and advanced users.
- **Score Evolution**: Tracks score changes over time to visualize learning progress and encourage consistent study habits.
- **Best Practice Warnings**: Educates about best practices, warning when deviations occur and explaining potential impacts.
